Present value and risk measures
-------------------------------

The library is using a visitor pattern in the instrument description. The instances of those visitors related to computing risk measures are called "Calculator".

The simplest one is the **PresentValueDiscountingCalculator** which, as his name indicates, computes the present value by simple discounting (and forward) computation. In particular, no convexity adjustment or volatility is used.
